REGEX



-------------------------------------------------------


find data very easy, 
 Regular expression or Regex for short is a way to search pattern in a big text of data. RegEx is al
so used for data validation like secure password, correct email format but it's usage can be extended


to use . we have to escape it using \. and \is used as \\

. -> match any character except new line
\d -> Digit(0-9)
\D -> not a digit 
\w -> word character(a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)
\W -> not a word character
\s -> whitespace 
\S -> Not a whitespace

\b -> word boundary i.e ha haha \bha\b will choose first ha \bha will 2nd and ha\b will choose 3rd
\B -> not a word boundary
^ -> begin of a string 
$ -> end of the string

[] -> character set [-.]
[1-7] range
[a-zA-Z]
[^a-z] -> not a-z (works as negation)

ex mat pat cat rat
[^r]at then it will choose all ending with at except starting with r

quantifier
----
* -> 0 or more
+ -> 1 or more 
? -> 0 or 1
{3} -> exact number
{3,5} -> range of numbers

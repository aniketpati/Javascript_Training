Everything in javascript happens in excution context
javacript is sunchronous single threaded language

Execution context --> variable environment, Thread of execution

Phases 1. Memory creation 2. execution -> execution context is pushed to call stack
Memory creation --> in case of variables it stores undefined and in case of function it stores the 
entire function

Execution -> the value is placed in place of undefined
when a function is envoked a new exection contex is created for that function
in the call stack.

Hoisting -> memory is allocated before executing the program
let and const are hoisted but present in temporal dead zone where we cant access them before
declaration var is hoisted, function is whole hoisted and variables with var
are hoisted as undefined. Function are completely hoisted, if need any value which is not declared
yet, it will be declared and function is completed.

Arrow function and anonmous function  are not hoisted, arrow function behave as variable

Scope-> any function while try to access a variable will check for the variable in its lexical 
scope (it go outside local environment -> global) not the reverse.
NOTE
var are hoisted in global scope (but let and const are hoisted but present in temporal dead zone 
so we cant access them)

let and const
these are hoisted but attach in temporal dead zone before declaration where these cannot be accesse
d before declaration. var is attached to global object but let and const dont attach to window object
let and const cannot be redeclared. Declaration and assign is done in same line in case of const
these are block scoped

var a = 10;
{
   var a = 100;
}
here value of a is modified because of Shadowing a = 100

let a = 10
{
   let a = 100;
}
here value of a = 10 //blockscoped 

closures
function along with the lexical scope bundel together forms closure

example of closure

function x(){
    let a = 7;
    function y(){
        console.log(a);
    }
	//if a = 100; then z() will return 100 because closure store reference to that varible	
    return y; //not only return function but also its lexical scope varibles
}

let z = x();
//...........

z();

when we are invoking y we are accessing a which is no longer is in the memory, but function memorise
its lexical scope environment variables and we can use them, this is broadly closure.

setTimeout 

function x(){
    for(var i=1; i<=5; i++){
        setTimeout(function(){
            console.log(i, " ");
        }, i*1000);
    }
}

x();
//output of above code is 6 6 6 6 6 because of closure, it is printing
// the reference to i.

//if we use let instead, it will be 1 2 3 4 5 because let is blocked scoped 
//else we can  add a extra function

function x(){
    for(var i=1; i<=5; i++){
        function close(x) {
        setTimeout(function(){
            console.log(x, " ");
        }, x*1000);
    }
    close(i);
    }
}

x();


First class functions

//Function statement/Function declaration --> hoisted
function a(){
	console.log("print")
}

//Function expression  --> not hoisted 

var a = function(){
	return 1;
}

//Anonymous function
 dont have identity so always require to assign it, used when act like a value
 var a = function(){
//.........
}

//Named function expression

var a = function b(){
	//....
}

//if we call b() then it will throw error(reference error)

//First class functions

we can pass functions as argument and can return a function, --this ability is called as the first 
class function 

//Arrow functions
